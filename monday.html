The Kwara State Public Library was established in 1968 following the creation of the state in May 29, 1967. With the emergence of kwara state in 1967, the former Northern region was divided into six states out of which emerged kwara state with Ilorin as capital.<br> Following the creation of kwara state the federal ministry of information contacted the British ministry of Overseas Development (B.M.O.D) asked for the help of a library adviser to come and assist in dividing the assets of the regional library into six newly created Northern states Mr. Robert Pearce was therefore assigned to come to Nigeria to help in division of the regional library assets.
